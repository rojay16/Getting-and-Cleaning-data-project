## Cleaning and Summarizing data for accelerometer and gyrometer exercise data


The script presented in the this repositiory tidies a data set of variables caluclated from from the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements
from participants in a study doing several different exercise activities. The dataset is from the UC Irvine machine learning repositiory. The original data set was comprised of a trial data set and a test data set. The tidied data set combines the two original data sets and filters the data to only contains mean and standard deviation calculations. 
The final data set then calcualtes mean of the previous calculations over the replicates of a given activity for a given subject. This project demonstrates the use of several functions and concepts of R, such as pre-processing data sets, grouping data, and performing calculations on the grouped data.

The script presented in the this repositiory tidies a data set of variables caluclated from from the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements
from participants in a study doing several different activities. The original data set was comprised of a trial data set and a test data set. The tidied data set combines the two original data sets but only contains mean and standard deviation calculations. 
The final data set then calcualtes mean of the previous calculations over the replicates of a given activity for a given subject. CodeBook.Md provides a code book for the 
tidied data set, explaining more about the original and tidied data set and the transformations done to it to generate the tidied data set.

## Codebook Overview

The data set this script tidies up is accelreometer and gyrometer data taken from a smartphone, when the smartphone was attatched to participants doing 6 different activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, standing ,sitting and lying down) for 30 different participants (the subjects are numbered 1-30 in the dataset). The oroginal dataset and experiment can be found here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The tidied data takes a subset of the data from these studies and calculates the mean of the variables of the subset, based on the ac done and the subject doing it. 

## The tidy data set
The original study took data from the gyrometer and accelormeters and found the following measurements

tBodyAcc-XYZ\
tGravityAcc-XYZ\
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ\
tBodyGyro-XYZ\
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ\
tBodyAccMag\
tGravityAccMag\
tBodyAccJerkMag\
tBodyGyroMag\
tBodyGyroJerkMag\
fBodyAcc-XYZ\
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ\
fBodyGyro-XYZ\
fBodyAccMag\
fBodyAccJerkMag\
fBodyGyroMag\
fBodyGyroJerkMag\

The actual original dataset was created by perfoming the following operations on each of the measurments above to generate 561 variables(such as the mean of tBodyAcc-X)

mean(): Mean value\
std(): Standard deviation\
mad(): Median absolute deviation\
max(): Largest value in array\
min(): Smallest value in array\
sma(): Signal magnitude area\
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.\
iqr(): Interquartile range\
entropy(): Signal entropy\
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4\
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals\
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude\
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency\
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal\ 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal\ 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.\
angle(): Angle between to vectors.\

In the tidied data set generated by the script we only collect the variables that calculated the mean and the standard deviation of the measurments for each subject and activity.Each subject did each activity multiple times (replicates) so the final tidied data calcualtes the mean for each vairable for a given actvity for a given subject over all the replicates done. Thus for example we will have the mean for tBodyAcc-X-std() ( the standard deviation of the body acceleration in the X direction) for all the replicates done for Subject 1 performing the activity of walking.
